● What is JSX?
--> 1) JSX is HTML-like or XML-like syntax. 
    2) JSX stands for JavaScriptXML. 
    3) It's a syntax extension for JavaScript.
    4)It is not a part of React. React apps can be built even without JSX but the code will become very hard to read.
    5)It is not HTML inside JavaScript.
    6)JavaScript engine cannot understand JSX as it only understands ECMAScript
    7) JSX (transpiled by Babel) ⇒ React.createElement ⇒ ReactElement ⇒ JS Object ⇒ HTML Element(render) 

● Superpowers of JSX
--> 1)JSX helps us keep our code simpler and elegant when writing large pieces of code.
    2)JSX also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.
    3)If one is familiar with HTML, it is quite easy to use JSX when building React application
    4)Faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript.

● Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?

    the <script> and </script> tags.
    Options that can use used there :-
    1) "text/javascript": This is the default and most common value, indicating that the script is written in JavaScript
    2) text/ecmascript: Another MIME type for ECMAScript, which JavaScript is based on.
    3)module: This value is used to indicate that the script is an ECMAScript module, allowing for features like import and export.

● {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs
{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX
--> Above all the syntax are same they are used to render the functional component which here is TitleComponent.
    This is the syntax that Babel understands.
