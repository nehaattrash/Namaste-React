● - What is `NPM`?
--> npm doesnot have an abbreviation . npm basically manages packages.
    It is the standard repository for all the packages. It is the biggest package manager.
    Any package you want to include in our project just use npm.

● - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
--> Parcel and Webpack are basically bundlers .
    When we have HTML, CSS , JS files , our whole code needs to be bundled together, minified,
    cached,compressed,cleaned before it can be sent to production .
    A Bundler helps us do all that thing.

● - What is `.parcel-cache`?
--> parcel-cache:
    Parcel caches code all the time.
    When we run the application, a build is created which takes some time in ms.
    If we make any code changes and save the application, another build will be triggered which might take even less time than the previous build.
    This reduction of time is due to parcel cache.
    Parcel immediately loads the code from the cache every time there is a subsequent build.
    On the very first build parcel creates a folder .parcelcache where it stores the caches in binary codeformat.
    Parcel gives faster build, faster developer experience because of caching.

● - What is `npx` ?
--> It stands for Node Package Execute and it comes with npm.
    when you installed npm above 5.2.0 version then automatically npx will installed. 
    It is an npm package runner that can execute any package that you want from the npm registry without even installing that package. 

● - What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?
--> dependencies are packages your application needs to run in production,
    while devDependencies are packages needed only during development and testing, not for the final product.
    Examples of dependencies include libraries that provide core functionality, while devDependencies include 
    testing frameworks, bundlers, and transpilers.

● - What is Tree Shaking?
--> Tree shaking is a process of removing the unwanted code that
    we do not use while developing the application.
    In computing, tree shaking is a dead code elimination
    technique that is applied when optimizing code.

● - What is Hot Module Replacement?
--> Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a web development technique that allows for the instant,
    in-browser updating of modules or components of an application without a full page reload. 
    By only refreshing the modified sections of the code, HMR maintains the application's state 
    and significantly speeds up the development cycle, offering developers a faster and more efficient way 
    to see code changes in action.
    Bundlers like Parcel use HMR technique using file watching algorithm (written in C++)

● - List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your
own words.
--> 1. Hot Module Replacement (HMR) (answered above)
    2. File Watcher Algorithm - C++ (answered above)
    3. Bundling (It bundles our whole code together)
    4. Minify Code (It compresses our code)
    5. Cleaning our code (It removes all the unnecessary white spaces and console.log statements)
    6. Dev and production build (It generates dev ready and production ready app for us)

● - What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
--> .gitignore is the file where we write all the files and folder name that we don't want to push to git.
    We should add those files in .gitignore which can be regenerated by executing the commands . ex - node_modules are generated when we run npm install 
    We should not add those files which can't be regenerated or are very specific . ex - index.html , package.json.

● - What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`?
--> In package. json we have information about generic version of installed packages whereas in package.lock.json we have
    information about the specific or exact version of installed packages.

● - Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
--> package-lock.json meticulously records the exact version of every package and its 
    dependencies installed in a project. This ensures that npm install will always install the
    identical set of dependencies, regardless of when or where it is run. Manual changes can break this guarantee,
    leading to different environments having different dependency versions and potentially introducing bugs or unexpected behavior.

● - What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
--> Which gets installed is like a database for the npm.
    Every dependency in node_module will have its package.json.
    Node modules are very heavy so we should always put this in git ignore , hence it is not pushed to git.

● - What is the `dist` folder?
--> It keeps the files minified for us. When bundler builds the app, the build goes into a folder called dist.
    The `/dist` folder contains the minimized and optimised version the source code.

● - What is `browserlists`?
--> Browserslist is a tool that specifies which browsers should be supported/compatible in your frontend app.
    We define it in our package.json.

Read about dif bundlers: vite, webpack, parcel
--> For parcel refer to my handwritten notes.

● Read about: ^ - caret and ~ - tilda
--> ^ caret - it means if there will be any minor version update then it will upgraded automatically.
    ~ tilda - it means if there is an major version update then it will be upgraded automatically.
    Usually caret is preferred over tilda because major version updates can break our code.

● Read about Script types in html (MDN Docs)
--> The type attribute specifies the type of the script.
    The type attribute identifies the content between the <script> and </script> tags.
    Ex - The type="module" attribute in an HTML <script> tag indicates that the linked 
    JavaScript file or inline script content should be treated as an ECMAScript module (ES module).
