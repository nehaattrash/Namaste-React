Assignment
● Is JSX mandatory for React?
--> JSX is not mandatory for React. While it is widely used and recommended for its benefits,
    you can write React applications using only plain JavaScript.

● Is ES6 mandatory for React?
--> ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is not strictly mandatory for using React, but it is highly recommended 
    and widely adopted within the React ecosystem.

● {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs
{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX
--> Above all the syntax are same they are used to render the functional component which here is TitleComponent.
    This is the syntax that Babel understands.

● How can I write comments in JSX?
--> 1) Enclose the comment in curly braces {}: This signals to JSX that the content inside is JavaScript.
    2) Use JavaScript's multi-line comment syntax /* ... */ within the curly braces: This is the actual comment format.
    3) {/* .. */}

● What is <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> and <></> ?
--> <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> and <></> both represent React Fragments, 
    which are a feature in React that allows you to group multiple elements returned 
    by a component's render method without adding an extra node to the DOM
    Example :-
    
    import React from 'react';

    function MyComponent() {
      return (
        <React.Fragment>
          <p>First element</p>
          <p>Second element</p>
        </React.Fragment>
      );
    }

● What is Virtual DOM?
--> 1) React virtual dom is basically the js object which is a ReactElement. 
    2) Remember, when we write the React.createElement(h1,{},”Hi”); It creates a ReactElement 
       and this React Element at the end of day is a Js Object .And this object is virtual dom .The object keeps virtual dom with itself.
    3) Virtual Dom is basically representation of actual DOM.

● What is Reconciliation in React?
--> Reconciliation in React is the process by which React efficiently updates the actual Document Object Model (DOM)
    to reflect changes in a component's state or props. It is a core mechanism that enables React's performance optimizations in handling UI updates.
    How it works:
    1) Virtual DOM Comparison:
       When a component's state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree representing the updated UI. It then compares this new Virtual DOM tree with the previous Virtual DOM tree.
    2) Diffing Algorithm:
       React's "diffing" algorithm analyzes the differences between the two Virtual DOM trees. This algorithm aims to identify the minimal set of changes required to update the actual DOM.
    3) Minimal DOM Updates:
       Based on the identified differences, React calculates the most efficient way to apply these changes to the real DOM. Instead of re-rendering the entire UI, it only updates the specific parts of the DOM that have changed, added, or been removed. This minimizes costly DOM manipulations, leading to improved performance.

● What is React Fiber?
--> Definition : 
    React Fiber is a complete reimplementation of React's core reconciliation algorithm, introduced in React 16.
    Its primary purpose is to enhance rendering performance and enable smoother user experiences, especially in 
    complex applications with animations, layouts, and gestures. 

    Key Features and Concepts:
    1) Incremental Rendering:
       Fiber breaks down the rendering work into smaller units, allowing React to pause and resume work as needed. 
       This prevents long-running tasks from blocking the main thread and ensures a more responsive UI.
    2) Prioritization:
       Fiber enables React to prioritize updates based on their urgency. 
       For instance, user interactions like clicks or input changes receive higher priority than
       background data fetching or less critical updates.
    3) Concurrency:
       Fiber's architecture lays the groundwork for concurrent mode,allowing React to handle multiple updates 
       simultaneously without blocking the main thread, leading to more fluid and interactive UIs.
    4) Work-in-Progress Tree:
       React Fiber utilizes two trees: the "current" tree representing what's currently rendered on the screen, 
       and the "work-in-progress" tree where all updates and changes are applied. Once the work-in-progress tree is 
       complete and consistent, React swaps pointers, making it the new current tree and updating the UI in a single, atomic operation.
    5) Fiber Nodes:
       Each React element corresponds to a Fiber node, which is a plain JavaScript object representing a unit of work.
       These nodes contain information about the element's type, state, props, and pointers to its parent, child, and sibling 
       Fiber nodes, forming a linked list structure that facilitates efficient traversal and reconciliation. 

● Why we need keys in React? When do we need keys in React?
--> Why ?
    Keys in React are special string attributes that help React identify which items in a list have changed, 
    are added, or are removed.They are crucial for efficient list rendering and maintaining component state.
    When ?
    Keys are primarily needed when rendering lists of elements or components using methods like map(), 
    filter(), or other iterative approaches that create multiple sibling elements.(ie elements at same level)

● Can we use index as keys in React?
--> No we should not use index as keys in React (it is not recommended).
    Reason :-
    Array indices are not stable identifiers. If the order of items in the list changes
    (due to sorting, filtering, adding, or removing items), the indices will shift, causing React to lose track of component identities. 

● What is props in React? Ways to
--> 1) Props is a short form of properties.
    2) When we want to pass data dynamically to a component we can pass it as props.
    3) A functional component is basically a js function returning jsx. So, props can be though of as the 
       the arguments to a function .
       example = <Restaurant name="KFC" place="CP">
       here name and place are the props passed to Restaurant component.

● What is a Config Driven UI ?
--> Our websites are driven by data and this is known as config driven Ui.
A config-driven UI is a user interface that defines its structure, layout, and 
behavior through external configuration files (like JSON or YAML) instead of hardcoding them directly into the application's codebase.
This design pattern separates UI logic from the code, allowing developers to modify the UI's appearance and functionality by simply updating
the configuration data, which makes the interface more flexible, scalable, and easier to customize without requiring changes to the underlying code
