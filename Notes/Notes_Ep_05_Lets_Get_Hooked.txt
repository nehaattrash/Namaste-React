● What is the difference between Named Export, Default export and * as export?

--> In JavaScript modules, named exports and default exports are two distinct mechanisms for making values available for use in other modules.
1) Named Exports:
--> Purpose: To export multiple specific values from a module.
--> Syntax: Use the export keyword followed by the declaration of the variable, function, or class.
// module.js
    export const PI = 3.14;
    export function add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
Importing: Requires importing the specific names enclosed in curly braces, matching the exported names.
// main.js
    import { PI, add } from './module.js';
    console.log(PI); // 3.14
    console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
--> Allows multiple exports per module.

2) Default Exports:
--> Purpose: To export a single, primary value from a module.
--> Syntax: Use export default followed by the value to be exported (which can be a variable, function, class, or object).
    // module.js
    const greeting = "Hello, World!";
    export default greeting;

    // Or directly:
    // export default function sayHello() {
    //     console.log("Hello!");
    // }
Importing: Does not require curly braces and allows assigning any local name to the imported value.
    // main.js
    import myGreeting from './module.js';
    console.log(myGreeting); // Hello, World!
--> Only one default export is allowed per module.

3) * in export 
In React, the * symbol used with export signifies a re-export of all named exports from another module. This is a shorthand for exporting multiple items without explicitly listing each one.
Example:
Consider a file named utils.js with several named exports:
// utils.js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;
export const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;

If you want to re-export all of these from another file, say index.js, you can use the * syntax:

// index.js
export * from './utils.js'; 
Now, any file importing from index.js will have access to add, subtract, and multiply as if they were directly exported from index.js.

● What is the importance of config.js file
--> Config.js file is basically constants.js file in our project .
    It is used to store all the hardcoded values used in our project . Since these values can be used at 
    multiple places in our project , so instead of writing that hardcoded value again and again (not good practice)
     we store it in constants.js.

● What are React Hooks?
--> React Hooks are normal Javascript functions . These are the utility function given to us by React.
    React Hooks are pre-built functions have underlying logic and these functions are written by the facebook developers.
    When we install React using npm we gain access to this superpower. Two most popular hooks are :-
    1) useState
    2) useEffect
    In order to use hooks in our project we have to import it from "react" (and it is a named import)
    import {useState} from "react";

● Why do we need a useState Hook?
--> useState hooks are used to create superpowerful state variables. React keeps track of these state variables.
    And whenever there is a change in the state variable , React triggers the reconciliation process and re-renders the Component.
    State variables are used to keep Ui layer in sync with the data layer.
    Syntax :-
    const [listOfStudents, setStudents] = useState([]);
